# Norms  

**Q4a:** How will your group handle situations when there is conflict in your group?  

If there is a personal conflict, we will focus on the success of the project and not let it affect the workflow. If the conflict is proffesional, we will have a discussion about to convince the other about our side, and if that isn't enough we vote for it

**Q4b:** How will your group handle situations when a member is not contributing enough?  

First, we will remind them of the work. A few chances will be given to each member, and those who don't pull their weight will be expected to make up for it later, or at least not repeat that same mistake. If a member is completely ghosting the team or not listeing to warnings, we will mention it to the professor(for a paper trail) and cook them in the group evaluation

# Track 2: Technology for Public Goods 

**Problem 2:** There are no good web applications dedicated to student interaction or sharing knowledge ethically. Most of the current popular student websites involve academic dishonesty, like Chegg.

**Solution 2:** Student social media/wiki app where students can post notes, links to helpful videos, upcoming events, or other student related posts. It will be divided based on university or subject, and there will be logins based on school accounts, with bookmarks and created posts tied to account.

# Idea Finalization

**From 5 project ideas you have above, please choose one of the project that you are going with for the rest of the semester. Explain why you are going with that project**

The idea we are going with is the student social media/wiki(solution 2). It has the most room for finnesse, while not being as niche in use or complicated to implement as some other ideas. Also, we can implement all the extra credit questions using this idea.

# Extra Credit (Only do this if you are done with Idea Finalization)

## Database Design

**Q1: What database are you using for your project (SQLite, PostgreSQL, noSQL, MongoDB,...), and why do you choose it?**

The database will be PostgreSQL. The reason is because we need a cloud-based database, and all of us have prior experience in SQLite so it will be an easy transition.

**Q2: How will database be helpful to your project? How will you design your database to support your application features?**

Since theres a sign-in part of the app, the database will be used to record user data(username,email,password,bookmarks,etc).
There will 

## Third-Party API Integration

**Q3: Which third-party API(s) will you integrate into your project? What data will you pull from the API(s), and how will you use it in your application?**

IPStack, Auth0(or a similar authentication API), and some continuos deployment API like BitRise. IPStack will be used to check the location of the user and recomend university pages for them to check out. 

**Q4: Does your API key has limitations such as rate limits or downtime? How are you going to deal with that?**

## Authentication and Security

**Q5: What authentication method will you use (e.g., username/password, OAuth, JWT)?**

**Q6: How will you store and protect sensitive user data (e.g., passwords, tokens)?**

## Deployment

**Q7: Where will you deploy your project (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Render)? How will you manage environment variables and secrets during deployment?**

**Q8: How will you ensure your deployment is reliable and easy to update?**
